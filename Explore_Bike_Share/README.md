### Project overview
This project uses Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. You will write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to your questions.

### Datasets
- The bike shars system data is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/). 
The bike sharing statitics will be compared among three large cities in US: Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C

- Three files contain the same six columns: 

| Start Time | End Time | Trip Duration | Start Station | End Station | User Type |
|---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |---- |
|e.g., 2017-06-23 15:09:32|e.g., 2017-06-23 15:14:53|e.g., 321 (s)| e.g., Clark St & Elm St | e.g., Damen Ave & Chicago Ave | Subcriber |

- Chicago and New York City have two more columns : Gender and Birth Year  

### Requirements
- Python 3, NumPy, Pandas, recommend installation using Anaconda
- Text editor, recommend using Atom
- Terminal application
